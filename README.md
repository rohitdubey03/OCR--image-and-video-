# OCR--image-and-video-


Optical Character Recognition(OCR) is the process of electronically extracting text from images or any documents like PDF and reusing it in a variety of ways such as full text searches.

## pytesseract:
It will recognize and read the text present in images. It can read all image types - png, jpeg, gif, tiff, bmp etc. Itâ€™s widely used to process everything from scanned documents.
